# Slides for 'Not all equals() methods are created equal'

This repo contains the code that serves as slides for my EqualsVerifier talk 'Not all equals() methods are created equal'.

This branch is empty and serves as an index. Each time I gave the presentation, I created a new branch that contains precisely what I showed that time.
